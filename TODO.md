## To Do:
- Remove hardcoded arrays of teachers/classrooms/students and create tables in SQLite
- Graphing
  - Let the student see their personal graph with data from previous scores
  - Click on a student in the Admin page to see their scores and graph.
- Implement jQuery instead of Native JavaScript
- Update stylesheet (see https://wild-alluring-nova.glitch.me)
- Allow Teachers to manage classes and students on the Admin page
  - Adding new classes, marking classes as deleted, adding children to classes, etc.
